            <h2 class="lySectionTitle">What Does Customer Loyalty Really Mean?</h2>
            <p>Think of the ice cream shop you stop by occasionally, the brand of sneakers you have three pairs of, or the make of your first car which you still recommend to family and friends without hesitation. When a brand is able to create personalized experiences which become cherished memories for the customer, loyalty is realized.</p>
            <p>In its simplest sense, customer loyalty is a customer's willingness to repeatedly return to a company to conduct business. It’s what drives customers to choose a brand over a competitor offering similar benefits.</p>

            <h2 class="lySectionTitle">What is a Customer Loyalty Program?</h2>
            <p>A customer loyalty program is a marketing approach that recognizes and rewards customers for associating with a brand on a recurring basis. A company may dole out points or perks, and graduate customers to higher loyalty levels. These incentives and benefits often result in the customer becoming a more regular consumer and a brand promoter.</p>
            <p>Loyalty programs rely on engaging fundamental human behavioral drivers, such as -</p>

            <p>Whether you’re promoting coffee sales, ride-hailing services, or credit card usage, loyalty programs are a way for companies to engage with every single customer in their ecosystem.</p>
            <p>Traditionally, businesses have considered purchase as the sole indicator of customer loyalty - rewarding repeat purchases and aiming for customer retention. But loyalty initiatives today are built with a complete view of customer activity and their omnichannel interactions with the business. So they recognize customer loyalty in all its expressions (along with sales), and encourage customers to engage actively, earn, and benefit from loyalty rewards.</p>

            <h2 class="lySectionTitle">Why Have a Loyalty Program?</h2>
            <p>Most marketing initiatives are effective because they are time-bound. Say, for example, the Black Friday Sale is successful, because it’ll end soon. On the other hand, a loyalty program is effective for exactly the opposite reason. Customers see a loyalty program as a brand’s promise of ongoing association unspoiled by time. This is why customers respond to loyalty programs differently than any other marketing invention.</p>
            <p>In an increasingly crowded market, loyalty programs can differentiate you from your competitors and keep your customers around. There truly are endless benefits but let’s consider the essential ones -</p>

                        <p>Verified online reviews carry a lot of weight for potential customers researching products and services online.

                        <p>Any engagement or personalization is designed using customer data. The more authentic the data, the clearer the insights. There have always been ways to gather first-party data on your customers, but with loyalty membership sign-ups, customers share their data and preferences willingly in exchange for value. So loyalty programs can bring in zero-party data, which is immensely valuable in designing positive customer experiences.

            <h2 class="lySectionTitle">Types of Loyalty Programs</h2>
            <p>There are many types of loyalty programs since there are no limitations on your vision for customer experience —especially with modern technology platforms. All programs can be distilled down to the basic process of purchases or actions for earning rewards, but where you go from there is up to you.</p>
            <p>What matters most is that your customers find the program’s experience and incentives not just engaging but compelling. Aside from meeting your customer’s expectations, any type of program can be successful.</p>
            <h3>Point-based loyalty program</h3>
            <div class="lyInfoList">
                <div class="lyInfoItem">
                    <div class="lyInfoText">
                        <p>This is the simplest form of a modern loyalty program, where customers earn points for every transaction or specific action. These points can then be redeemed for discounts, additional merchandise, experiences,  memberships or subscriptions for other services. Traditionally, points-based loyalty programs operate on a flat structure—all points have the same value regardless of when the purchase was made or for what, and all customers redeem points for the same selection of rewards.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="lyInfoPoints">
                        <span>Pros</span>
                        <span>● Maintains price integrity</span>
                        <span>● Flexible, customizable and currency can be sold to partners to fund the program</span>
                        <span>● Promotes higher purchase frequency and conversion</span>
                        <span>● Suitable for high-value customers</span>

                        <p>While tiered programs incentivise customers to spend more or more often, they operate similarly to points-based programs. The difference is that members who accumulate enough points in a given timeframe join a new tier that offers better rewards. What makes tiered-loyalty programs so successful is their ability to effect customer buying behavior. It encourages repeat purchases and is helpful in increasing the average order value (AOV).</p>

                        <p>Some loyalty programs require an up-front cost to gain access to exclusive deals and opportunities. Such fee-based loyalty programs work by offering relevant value to highly engaged customers - whether it's in the form of free shipping, special discounts or priority access to sales. Having a membership fee also creates a de facto customer segmentation.</p>

            <p>Running a loyalty program involves common costs and varying costs. The price you pay depends on the scale of your program, your specific requirements and how you choose to operate it for your customers. So the varying costs are always case-specific. Let’s consider the common costs for running a successful loyalty program.</p>

                        <h3>Initial setup</h3>
                        <p>This typically requires investing in a technology platform or software to manage the program. The setup cost includes -</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>purchasing or developing a loyalty management system</li>
                            <li>integrating it with your existing CRM</li>
                            <li>ensuring it is accessible across various channels (online, in-store, mobile apps)</li>
                            <li>program design to ensure the program aligns with your brand and customer expectations</li>

                        <h3>Rewards and incentives</h3>
                        <p>The most direct cost of a loyalty program is the rewards themselves, whether they are discounts, free products, exclusive services, or points redeemable. Maintaining sufficient inventory of reward items (particularly if they are physical goods) can add to operational costs. Though taking a larger view, the cost per member and rewards costs should be fairly negligible, especially if the program boosts sales.</p>

                        <p>Word of mouth and customer-facing staff will help market a loyalty program. But to truly grow a loyalty program, significant investment is required in communicating it to everyone. In the start of the program this means communicating to attract enrollment, which involves costs for promotions and incentives for initial sign-ups. On an on-going basis, you communicate with the members to keep them active, informed about any changes to the program and building engagement.</p>

                        <p>When you first get started, you and your team may juggle the responsibilities of running a loyalty program alongside other tasks. This can help the team members see how the program can be integrated into other (seemingly unrelated) activities and technologies. We often see marketing, e-commerce, CRM or Customer Success Managers sharing the initial loyalty tasks. As your program starts picking up, it will become essential to have a dedicated team in place, ensuring a smooth loyalty experience for the members, driving member engagement, and maximizing your return on investment.</p>

            <p>In sectors with high-frequency customer interactions, the accumulated customer data alone can often justify investment in a loyalty program—particularly as the programs offer  ways to monetize the data through highly personalized engagement.</p>
            <p>In addition, loyalty programs can help introduce new revenue streams for the business. Remember that - </p>
            <ul>
                <li>A successful loyalty program will continue to evolve and bring new costs.</li>
                <li>Prepare to invest more money – and in new areas – as the loyalty scheme gains traction.</li>
                <li>Always balance the customer proposition with business economics.</li>

            <p>The software platform is the heart of your loyalty program. And represents the biggest decision you’ll make when setting up your loyalty program - i.e. do you build the platform yourself or purchase and customize a third-party software?</p>
            <p>Developing the loyalty software in-house gives you full control over the process, its functionality, and intellectual property (IP) - which guarantees that the end product will reflect your vision. But it also requires a significant amount of time, as you’ll need to figure out everything about designing and running a loyalty program from scratch. You will also need to work with loyalty and CRM experts, strategists, and technology advisors to oversee the build and implementation. And dedicate your internal staff to full-time frontend and backend roles, prioritizing them away from existing projects.</p>
            <p>The main benefit of SaaS Loyalty software is that the company behind it has both the knowledge and technology to help you set up and run your loyalty program faster. Since the backend is already set up and ready, you only need to take care of the concept and the front end. This enables you to develop a program that meets your specific budget and requirements. In addition, if you are looking to partner with other brands and build a loyalty ecosystem, the SaaS Loyalty solutions company can put you in touch with other brands, which cater to the same customers as you do.</p>

            <p>Gone are the days when loyalty programs were just a marketing tool for driving repeat purchases & promoting customer retention. Loyalty programs today are complete platforms spanning the customer journey end-to-end. And they can help businesses achieve a whole lot (apart from sales)- new customer sign-ups, better engagement, brand advocacy, re-invigorating dormant customers, predicting revenue streams, creating differentiation in competitive markets, and more.</p>
            <p>The present-day programs can seamlessly aggregate data from all channels and create a unified customer profile. With this singular and complete understanding of your customer, you can design and deliver hyper-personalized engagements at the right time for maximum impact. So what does it mean to have a successful loyalty program? You decide! </p>
            <p>You can begin by asking some key questions to arrive at a relevant KPI -</p>
            <ul>
                <li>How should our market position and long-term strategy shape the vision and objectives for the program?</li>
                <li>Which customers are we really designing for? - existing or potential? What income levels or age groups? And what will truly affect their behavior?</li>
                <li>How can we use the program to differentiate ourselves?</li>
                <li>How does our perceived product/service value shape the program benefits - such as discounts, recognition, and exclusivity?</li>
                <li>Will the program design be durable with time and as customer behavior changes?</li>
                <li>What tangible benefits can we give customers that provide the highest value at the lowest relative cost?</li>
                <li>What benefits can we create for the customers right now?</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Answering these questions will help establish a measure for program success, understand loyalty, and what all you can do with it.</p>

                        <p>From messaging to rewards - every aspect of your program should be as personalized as possible for each customer. Personalization is critical to developing the emotional connections that foster customer loyalty. Skipping on personalization and generalizing the experience will leave them disinterested. The same happens if your program does not offer or is unable to highlight ‘members-only’ features. To avoid this problem - </p>

                    <div class="lyAccordionContent">
                        <p>Too many brands have a program where incentives are triggered by transactions only. In addition, these follow-up incentives are all transactional and do little to develop a relationship with the customer. Loyalty members are set apart from non-members by how they feel about your brand and their willingness to engage more deeply. By keeping the bulk of your rewards against transactions, you can end up diluting the member’s loyalty relationship with your brand to a transactional relationship. To avoid this problem -</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Rewards members for actions that are non-monetary like reading a piece of content, participating in a survey, or completing a task.</li>
                            <li>Experiential rewards tend to receive the most responses, create the highest engagement, and have lots of great memories to go with it. Look at your customer profile and add suitable experiential rewards to the program.</li>

                        <p>Discounts have their place in loyalty programs and are great for building a quick response over a short time span. But they are not relevant to building loyalty. Customers who respond to discounts are highly likely to switch brands in the absence of one.

                            <li>Consider integration technologies for registration and redemption. Registration is often most effective when it happens at the POS.

                        <p>Let’s say your program promises ‘Seamless returns’ to members.Which is only possible with use of point-of-sale technology, backed by operations and managed by in-store teams that can recognize repeat customers.

            <p>While all your marketing efforts can be layered into your loyalty program, it should be done carefully. Often in attempts to spice up the program, brands add new practices and conditions. And rather than creating excitement, it discourages customers and makes it challenging for them to join the program.

            <p>We are in the privacy-first era. Businesses are facing an increasingly complex challenge of collecting and leveraging consumer data without infringing on privacy concerns. While customers demand more personalized interactions, their awareness of privacy concerns also makes them wary of sharing personal information. </p>
            <p>The consumer data privacy regulations that have been put in place over the past few years (GDPR, CCPA) have also increased the awareness that not only do businesses have privacy regulations to comply with, but consumers have the right to secure their data. </p>

            <h2 class="lySectionTitle">Best Practices To Ensure That Data Remains An Asset</h2>
            <p>A loyalty program can have hundreds of data points on each member. So it is crucial to ensure that data is maintained in a manner that minimizes unwanted intrusion. A good rule of thumb is to treat customer data like you treat inventory. This helps to immediately arrive at the necessary practices for data management –  how to gather it, data stocking, establishing data shelf-life and correcting pilferage.</p>
            <b>Know what data you are collecting?</b>
            <p>Before you turn on the data collection initiatives, there must be a clear understanding of</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Why is the data required?</li>
                <li>Why now?</li>
                <li>How will this data be collected and stored?</li>
                <li>Who all (internally & 3rd party) will have access to the data?</li>
                <li>How will this customer data be used and not used?</li>
            </ul>
            <b>Follow data minimization.</b>
            <p>Data minimization approach dictates that enterprises should limit the collection of personal information to what is directly relevant and necessary to accomplish a specified purpose. Look to retain data only for as long as is necessary to fulfill the purpose. To evaluate which data is essential, conduct periodic data audits. Following minimization, enterprises can reduce their sensitive data footprint substantially.</p>
            <b>Encrypt all sensitive member data.</b>
            <p>Consider data pseudonymization (as one of the practices recommended by GDPR). It is the processing of personal data in such a way that the data can no longer be attributed to an individual without using additional information.</p>
            <p>Say, for example, removing a customer’s first and last name, and replacing it with randomly generated strings. The information is still useful, however, it is nearly impossible to link the identity of a user to this information. This greatly reduces the risk of identifiable information theft in case of data breaches.</p>
            <b>Create and publish a transparent data usage and privacy policy.</b>
            <p>Define and implement a clear data privacy policy and communicate it to all stakeholders. The policy should specify who is allowed to access the data and how. It should also clearly state how the data should and shouldn’t be used.</p>
            <p>Publish a privacy policy using clear and simple language for customers to read through. The policy should specify how your company collects, stores, uses, and protects customer data. Keep customers informed on any changes that are made to the policy.</p>
            <div class="lyVideoContainer">
                <div class="lyvideo">

            <p>Privacy-conscious companies enjoy deeper consumer loyalty, improved ROI and are less reliant on third-party data to make crucial business decisions. Businesses that can factor privacy into their loyalty initiatives will definitely ‘hear back from their customers’ and build long-term trust.</p>

            <h2 class="lySectionTitle">Not a Provider. Choose a Loyalty Partner. </h2>
            <p>In the world of customer retention, building a loyalty program stands out as a major endeavor for any company. Loyalty programs can be a game-changer if created with care and deployed with precision. And taking the first step is often the most daunting, with the many decisions to be made around your program.</p>
            <p>This is why brands must choose a loyalty service provider based on three things - they should understand emotional connections, gather and decode customer insights, and have strong project orchestration capabilities.</p>
